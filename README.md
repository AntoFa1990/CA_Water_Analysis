# Project Overview 
The stability of a safe and clean water supply, both as a source of drinking water and as a marine environment,  is an important priority for the people of California and their elected officials. Understanding the larger picture of what harmful chemicals are in the water, both in the present moment and over time, is an important foundational step for public health officials in making effective  policy decisions and recommendations on these issues..

This analysis considers exactly this question, with regard to three main chemicals,: Mercury, Arsenic and Nitrate.

These are all substances with well established negative health consequences, which can be mitigated through a variety of directed action (regulation of substances or industries, changed practices, cleaning plants, etc.). Arsenic, for instance, has a variety of bad effects in drinking water at levels as low as 30ppb. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water can lead to skin lesions, a variety of cancers, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. For pregnant mothers, exposure to arsenic in water can also impact their children’s cognitive development and can lead to premature death..  

Mercury, meanwhile, affects the human population mainly through the consumption of fish who have accumulated levels from a polluted environment, at levels even, lower, just 2ppb.


# Research Questions
There are a number of ways to come at this question, and a number of datasets available with which to consider it. While we have a further discussion ahead of both the data we chose as a group, how we manipulated it, as well as individual findings, these were the five main questions we looked at and our individual areas of focus:
What is the data picture of a single collection site over the entire historical period of collection? (Adam)
What are the difference in surface water samples vs. well water samples? (Antonette)
What are the historic trends for the presence of Arsenic & Mercury  among CA highested populated counties (LA, San Diego, Alameda, Sacramento)? (Lorela)
What are the recent  trends for Nitrate among CA most populated counties? (Brittni)
What are the recent  trends for Mercury among CA most populated counties? (Angelica)


# Description of Dataset
Data was sourced from the publically available CA Open Data repositories, which houses a collection of numerous, state collected datasets about essential public infrastructure like water, housing,etc. Through Open Data, he California Department of Water Resources (DWR) offers a number of discrete “grab” water quality datasets, containing DWR-collected, current and historical, chemical and physical parameters found in drinking water, groundwater, and surface waters throughout the state. Specifically, this analysis considered the 4.5 mil. record "Lab Data" subset, which consisted of Lab samples taken from various wells in counties throughout California from 1952 (and sporadically before). Records included information on sample date, parameters tested for, type of sample and locational information.
